📖 study buddy v0.1 📖


 - highly simple

 - has only bare bones functions

 - input questions to the system

 - system feeds questions back to you when prompted

how to use: at the moment the only way i can figure it out is by downloading it, loading it into vscode (or other ide) and opening a preview through an extension 😔 
tips appreciated because i'm new and have no idea what i'm doing
